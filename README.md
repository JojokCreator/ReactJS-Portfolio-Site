# My Portfolio Site
## Overview
This is my personal portfolio site, where I showcase my frontend development projects and skills. The site is built using React. It also includes some useful libraries, such as Framer Motion and Formspree.

# Features
- A landing page that displays my recent projects and personal information
- A clean and easy-to-navigate design that highlights my work
- A contact form using Formspree for visitors to reach out to me directly
- Integration with Sanity.io for managing and displaying project images and descriptions
- Use of Framer Motion library for smooth and engaging animations.

# Backend
## Sanity.io
I chose to use Sanity.io as my backend for managing and displaying project images and descriptions. Sanity.io is a headless CMS that provides a flexible schema and an intuitive user interface to help create, manage and display content for my portfolio site. It provided a perfect solution for me as it has several advantages like its ease of use, flexibility, and scalability.

# Libraries Used
## Framer Motion
I used Framer Motion library to add some design elements to my portfolio site. This library helps to create engaging animations and transitions between different elements on the site. This was useful in adding a touch of beauty and interest to the site, and it also helped to improve user engagement.

## Formspree
Formspree was a useful library in this project because I needed an easy way for visitors to contact me. The Formspree API made it easy to create a simple contact form, and it also helped me to avoid the hassle of setting up a server and managing the backend.
